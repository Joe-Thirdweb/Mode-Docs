# üóÇÔ∏è Data Indexers

## [Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/)

Goldsky offers two core self-serve products that can be used independently or in conjunction to power your data stack. Subgraphs that have flexible indexing with typescript, with support for webhooks and more. Then also Mirror which lets you get live blockchain data directly into your database or message queues with a single yaml config.\

## [SQD](https://sqd.dev/)

SQD unlocks next-gen functionality for dApps, AI agents, analytics and ZK Proofs/TEE through blazing-fast indexing.

SQD is a decentralized hyper-scalable data platform optimized for providing efficient, permissionless access to large volumes of data. It currently serves historical on-chain data, including event logs, transaction receipts, traces, and per-transaction state diffs. SQD offers a powerful toolkit for creating custom data extraction and processing pipelines, achieving an indexing speed of up to 150k blocks per second.

To get started, visit their [documentation](https://docs.sqd.dev/) or see their [EVM examples](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-evm-examples) of what you can build with SQD.
