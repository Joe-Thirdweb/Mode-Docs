## Introduction - Global Addresses

Mode leverages [ZeroDevâ€™s Global Address](https://global-address.zerodev.app/) system to make transferring funds between Mode and centralized exchanges (CEXs) simple and flexible. A global address is a unique, chain-abstracted account that lets you send and receive assets (like USDC, USDT, and ETH) across different chains without the need for traditional bridging.

For Mode users, this means that moving funds to and from CEXs like Binance or Coinbase is seamless. By creating a global address, you can manage your assets across multiple chains as one unified balance, enabling fast and efficient transfers no matter where your assets are held.\
\
You can read [ZeroDev's documentation](https://zerodev.app/) to know more.

## Send funds from CEX to Mode

1. Select your Mode 0x address and paste it into the Receiver Address box on [https://global-address.zerodev.app/](https://global-address.zerodev.app/) and select Mode Mainnet as the Target Chain.\
   \
   Click Create a Global Address.

2.  Visit your favorite centralized exchange (Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, etc.)

    \
    Select your balance of USDC, USDT or ETH and click Send or Withdraw.\

3.  Choose the cheapest chain to withdraw to between Base, OP Mainnet, Polygon, Arbitrum One, Scroll, and Ethereum.\


    For example, withdrawing from Coinbase to Base is typically free. :wink:\

4. Choose the desired amount and paste **your Global Address you created** in Step 1 as the destination.&#x20;

Before sending your transaction, please double check that:\
\
1\. You are sending supported funds to a supported chain. Check all the combinations [here](https://zerodev.notion.site/ZeroDev-Global-Address-Supported-Tokens-137e616047d18088a11cc84ab56fc5cc).\
\
2\. You are sending the funds to your generated Global Address.\
\
3\. The target chain of the Global Address is pointing to Mode Mainnet\
\
Mistakes can lead to the loss of funds.

PRO TIP: \

While trying this flow for the first time, it's always recommended to send a small test transaction to make sure everything is working smoothly.
