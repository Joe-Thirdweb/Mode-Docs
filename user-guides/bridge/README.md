# ðŸŒ‰ Bridge

Mode's canonical bridge is a fork of Optimism's bridge. The bridge only allows moving funds from Mode to Ethereum Mainnet and viceversa. The tokens supported for now are ETH, USDC, USDT and WBTC. \
\
The ETH bridged from Ethereum mainnet to Mode is ETH on Mode mainnet as well, it's not a wrapped version as it is the base token of Mode.

We refer to "Deposit" when bridging from L1 to the L2 - [bridge-to-mode.md](bridge-to-mode.md "mention")\
\
We refer to "Withdrawal" when bridging from L2 to the L1 - [bridge-from-mode.md](bridge-from-mode.md "mention")\
