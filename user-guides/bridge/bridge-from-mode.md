description: Bridging ETH from Mode to Ethereum

# ⬅️ Bridge from Mode

Mode's bridge is a fork of Optimism's canonical bridge. With Optimism's Bedrock upgrade, a two-step withdrawal process designed to enhance the safety and integrity of cross-chain transactions was introduced.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can check the status of your withdrawal in the [Transactions](https://app.mode.network/transactions/) section.\
\
The 7 day withdrawal period is due to how optimistic rollups work, it's called the challenge period. Read more about it [here](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/bridging/messaging)
{% endhint %}
