<summary>4. Transaction Fee Points</summary>

As with Airdrop 1, users receive Mode Points for transaction fees paid on Mode. These fees are calculated by the gas spent when interacting with protocols to trade, swap, stake, lend and mint on Mode.

</details>

<details>

<summary>5. Volume points</summary>

Volume points aim to reward users for their transaction volumes across key pools on Kim, Supswap, SwapMode, Velodrome, and more with a share of 5 million points daily. These points will be distributed based on the users' share of the volume for that day. We run the calculations daily.

### Why do we do it?

The primary goal of Activity Points is to incentivize genuine transaction volumes on Mode. By excluding volumes from smart contracts, including multisig wallets, we ensure that rewards are allocated to individual users who actively participate and contribute to our ecosystem. This helps maintains the integrity of our reward system and fosters a more engaged community.

#### How does it work?

1. **Participation**: Users swap tokens within designated pools on supported dapps. Check volume pairs support in [#supported-volume-pairs](quick-start-1.md#supported-volume-pairs "mention")
2. **Volume Calculation**: The total volume from these pools is aggregated daily.
3. **Point Distribution**: Points are distributed based on each user’s share of the total daily volume. For example, a volume of 10 ETH will contribute to the user’s share of the total daily volume, impacting their points accordingly.

**Key Details**

* **Start Time**: Activity Points start accumulating from Block 9227209.
* **Daily Updates**: Calculations are confirmed daily at 11am UTC, and users can view their updated Activity Points on their dashboard at approximately 11.05am UTC.
